# OPCUA to Calvin

The example shows how to connect Calvin to an OPCUA server and, given a
list of node id's, either poll at a given interval, or setup subscriptions and
receive updates when a value changes.

Note that this has not been extensively tested against OPCUA servers. There seems
to be some incompatibilities between some OPCUA servers and the python
implementation `freeopcua` (which Calvin uses in the implementation.) In
partiular, subscriptions does not always work, thus the polling implementation.


## Setup

### Hardware

- A computer to run the script is enough.


### Installation

Install dependencies using:

    ยง pip install -r requirements.txt


## Running

Run the script with the following command:

    $ CALVIN_GLOBAL_STORAGE_TYPE=\"local\" csruntime --host localhost opcua-subscribe.calvin

## DHT

Calvin's internal registry is not strictly needed when running this small example,
it has therefor been turned off. To turn it on and run the application with DHT
instead, remove `CALVIN_GLOBAL_STORAGE_TYPE=\"local\"` from the command. I.e:

    $ csruntime --host localhost opcua-subscribe.calvin
