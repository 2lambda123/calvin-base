# Temperature & humidity monitor

A small app for monitoring the humidity and temperature using a Raspberry Pi
with a [Sense HAT](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/sense-hat/).


## Overview

The allowed range can be changed by modifying the following lines in the Calvin script.

    humid_range : std.SetLimits(lower=40, upper=80)
    temp_range: std.SetLimits(lower=20, upper=33)

and substituting whatever temperature and humidity is suitable. Note: Temperature is in centigrade (C).

When a value falls outside of the given interval, the background of the
SenseHat display will change to red and a tweet with the offending value will
be sent (if the twitter credentials are correctly configured in the
`twitter_credentials.json` file)

__NOTE__: Do _not_ use this application for monitoring live animals if their
well-being and/or life depends on it functioning correctly! It has not been
tested extensively and it cannot be guaranteed to function the way you expect
it to.


## Setup

### Hardware

The example assumes the following devices:

- A Raspberry Pi with a [Sense HAT](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/sense-hat/)

### Python packages

- [`sense-hat`](https://pythonhosted.org/sense-hat/)

### Installation

Using [`raspbian jessie lite`](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/), with a working calvin installation,
run `install-deps.sh` to install necessary dependencies for this example. Note: It may be a good idea to expand the file
if this is not already done using [`raspi-config`](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/raspi-config.md).


### Calvin configuration

The following plugins and paths needs to be loaded to run this script:
- `display_plugin`
- `environmental_sensor_plugin`
- `actor_paths`

A `calvin.conf` file is prepared for this purpose. For the `calvin.conf` to be
loaded, start the calvin script from within the directory the `calvin.conf`
file is placed. For other ways of loading the configuration, please see
the Calvin Wiki page about [Configuration](https://github.com/EricssonResearch/calvin-base/wiki/Configuration)



## Running

Run one of the following commands from within the directory the `calvin.conf` file is placed:

### With DHT

    with twitter output:
    $ csruntime --host localhost --keep-alive monitor-tweet.calvin --attr-file twitter_credentials.json

    or, without twitter output:
    ยง csruntime --host localhost --keep-alive monitor-print.calvin

### Without DHT

Calvin's internal registry is not strictly needed when running this small
example. To turn it off and run the application locally add `CALVIN_GLOBAL_STORAGE_TYPE=\"local\"`
to the command:

    with twitter output:
    $ CALVIN_GLOBAL_STORAGE_TYPE=\"local\" csruntime --host localhost --keep-alive monitor-tweet.calvin --attr-file twitter_credentials.json

    or, without twitter output:
    ยง CALVIN_GLOBAL_STORAGE_TYPE=\"local\" csruntime --host localhost --keep-alive monitor-print.calvin
